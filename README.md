## Prompt:
You will be creating a Computational Geometry package in Python. You must use the following tools/approaches when you develop your code:

Test-Driven Development
Version Planning 
Source Control (GitHub)
Use branches/merges
We will start small and develop this project as we go. Consider me to be your client. I'll be looking at demonstrations (via Webex or in class) and giving feedback/new feature requests as we move along to give you some practice with the kinds of conversations and requests you'll see from project clients. 

We have a fairly small set of features to begin with. 

You need to be able to represent the following on a plane (Euclidean 2-dimensional space):

Points
Line Segments
Circles
We may very well add other objects that need to be represented, or expand this to more dimensions, so keep that in mind when you design your approach. 

Your package must be able to perform the following:

Line segment intersection: Find the intersections between a given set of line segments.
Closest pair of points: Given a set of points, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.
Convex hull: Given a set of points, find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points, represented as the set of points on the polygon edge.
Largest empty circle: Given a set of points, find a largest circle with its center inside of their convex hull and enclosing none of them.
This is basically our "Version 1" of this project. You should use a Github Project to divide the task into some smaller milestones and start creating issues to keep you on target when developing this project. 

If you're not sure what some of this means, you can find good breakdowns and examples on the Wikipedia page for [Computational Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry). It has links to good descriptions of all of these in the Problem Classes section.

## Goals:

- Emphasis on learning test-driven development
- Use of Agile Methodologies
